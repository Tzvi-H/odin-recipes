  <p>This recipe is a family favorite that was passed down over the generations. Grandma and Pap just ate them plain, with a fork (sometimes dipped in ketchup), but our family likes to top these burgers with cheese and serve on a hamburger bun in a the traditional way. I have also seen these referred to as Kotlety Mielone. These can also be cooked on the grill.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  
  <ul>    
    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
    <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
    <li>½ green pepper, diced</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon sea salt</li>
    <li>2 slices white bread, torn into small pieces</li>
    <li>1 serving cooking spray with olive oil</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Directions</h3>
  <ol>    
    <li>Mix ground beef, onion, green pepper, egg, ketchup, and sea salt together in a bowl; mix in the white bread pieces until evenly distributed. Form the mixture into 4 patties.</li>
    <li>Spray a large skillet with olive oil cooking spray and set over medium heat. Cook the burgers until well-browned on the bottoms, about 10 minutes; flip the burgers and cook until the meat is no longer pink and the juices run clear, 8 to 10 more minutes.</li>
  </ol>
